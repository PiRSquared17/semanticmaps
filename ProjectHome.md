Semantic Maps is a MediaWiki extension that adds semantic capabilities to the Maps extension. This includes the ability to add, edit, aggregate and visualize coordinate data stored through Semantic MediaWiki. Since Semantic Maps uses the Maps API, you can use multiple mapping services. These include Google Maps (with Google Earth support), Yahoo! Maps, OpenLayers and OpenStreetMap.

Both Semantic Maps and Maps are based on Semantic Google Maps and Semantic Layers, and are meant to replace these extensions. Having Semantic MediaWiki and Maps installed is a prerequisite for the Semantic Maps extension; the code will not work without it.
